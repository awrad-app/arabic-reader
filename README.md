Paste Arabic, read with ease. A model of how the typography and core app experience will be.

This component aims to create the core reading experience for the Awrad app. 

Usage is self-explanatory, improvements to make are in 'issues' tab.

NOTE: the `master` branch is actually dev (for easy use of GH Pages for testing). `real-master` is the branch for shipping. (sorry I am lazy)
